<h1> Stephen's Skeletal System Site </h1>
<p> Overview </p>
<p> This project is about the many ways that coding relates to the skeletal system. </p>

<h2> Connection </h2>
<p> The skeletal system connects to coding in many ways, as they both 
  provide structure and function in living and digital things </p>

<h3> Structure and Function </h3>
<p> Coding has an element called a .css or Cascading Style Sheets.
  It tells a website exactly how it is supposed to look, like the skeleton. 
  The HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language, is what allows the site to function. 
  This goes with the skeletal system because joints allow your skeleton to move. </p>
